## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies

# Set up environment
cp ../.env.template ../.env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Initialize database
python -c "from app.database import init_db; init_db()"

# Run tests
python -m pytest tests/

uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## üìù Development Workflow

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring
- `test/description` - Test improvements

### Commit Messages
We follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```

## üß™ Testing

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Run health checks
./health-check.sh
