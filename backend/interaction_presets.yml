# INTERACTION TYPE PRESETS
# =============================================================================
# 
# These presets define which character interactions to track for different genres.
# Users can load a preset as a starting point and customize for their story.
#
# IMPORTANT: Use SPECIFIC, FACTUAL terms - never vague phrases.
# The purpose of tracking interactions is to maintain precise story continuity.
#
# RULE: If you can't objectively verify it happened by reading the scene,
# the term is too vague. Use explicit, observable actions only.
