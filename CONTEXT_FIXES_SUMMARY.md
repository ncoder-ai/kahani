# Context Management & Summary Modal Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Context Management Component Showing Wrong Token Count
**Problem**: Bottom ContextInfo component showing 4000 tokens instead of user's setting (25K)
**Root Cause**: ContextInfo component had hardcoded values and wasn't fetching real data
**Solution**: 
- Updated ContextInfo component to accept `storyId` prop
- Added API call to `/api/stories/{storyId}/summary` to get real context data
- Updated story page to pass `storyId` to ContextInfo component
- Added loading state and error handling

### 2. Summary Modal Not Scrollable  
**Problem**: Summary text was cut off with no way to scroll
**Root Cause**: Modal layout wasn't properly structured for scrolling
**Solution**:
- Restructured modal with flex layout: fixed header + scrollable content
- Added separate scrolling area for the summary text with max height
- Improved visual design with proper spacing and indicators
- Added "Scroll to read complete summary" hint

### 3. Auto-Open Last Story Settings Not Saving
**Problem**: Checkbox setting wasn't being saved to backend
**Root Cause**: Frontend wasn't including `auto_open_last_story` in save payload
**Solution**:
- Added `auto_open_last_story` to settings save function
- Added default values to backend UserSettings model
- Fixed context settings display with null checks

## Backend Enhancements:

### New API Endpoint: `GET /api/stories/{story_id}/summary`
Returns comprehensive story and context information:
```json
{
  "story": {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Story Title",
    "genre": "thriller",
    "total_scenes": 42
  },
  "context_info": {
    "total_scenes": 42,
    "recent_scenes": 5,
    "summarized_scenes": 37,
    "context_budget": 25056,
    "estimated_tokens": 22886,
    "usage_percentage": 91.3
  },
  "summary": "Story summary text..."
}
```

## Frontend Improvements:

### Enhanced ContextInfo Component
- Real-time data fetching from API
- Dynamic context budget display
- Color-coded usage indicators (red >90%, yellow >75%, blue normal)
- Proper error handling and loading states

### Improved Summary Modal
- Fixed header with close button
- Scrollable content area
- Dedicated scroll area for long summaries
- Better visual hierarchy and spacing
- Responsive design

## Testing Status:
✅ Context info now shows correct token budget from user settings
✅ Summary modal is fully scrollable
✅ Auto-open last story setting saves correctly
✅ All components handle loading and error states

The fixes ensure that users see accurate context management information and can fully interact with story summaries regardless of length.
